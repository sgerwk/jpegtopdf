.SH DESRIPTION

Create a single PDF file out of a sequence of JPEG image. Each page of the
output file contains one image, resized to be as large as possible while still
fitting the A4 size both horizontally and vertically.

.

.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI -n " margin
the margin to leave on all sides of the images

.TP
.BI -x " dx
the horizontal displament of the images in the page;
by default, they are placed centrally

.TP
.BI -y " dy
the vertical displament of the images in the page;
by default, they are placed centrally

.TP
.BI -w " width
the input images have this width;
this is usually unnecessary

.TP
.BI -e " height
the input images have this height;
this is usually unnecessary

.TP
.BI -s " scale
make the output page as big as the input image, scaled by this

.TP
.BI -r " rotations
each character in the argument tells how to rotate each input image; 0 is no
rotation, 1 is 90 degrees clockwise, 2 is 180 degrees clockwise, 3 is 270
degress clockwise; 'a' and 'A' are like 1 and 3 but only when the width of the
image is smaller than its height; if the string is shorter than the number of
pages, its last character is the rotation of the remaining pages; for example,
\fI-r 1\fP rotates all pages 90 degrees clockwise

.TP
.BI -o " file.pdf
the name of the output file; the default is
.I output.pdf

.TP
.B -t
sort pages to reconstruct a two-side document scanned with a single-side ADF;
in practice: scan the document front-side up, scan it again front-side down,
then use this option

.TP
.B -h
inline help

.
.
.
.SH NOTE

The JPEG images are directly copied to the output PDF file. This means that
resolution is not changed. However, the original JPEG images can be resized
with \fInetpbm(1)\fP before passing them to \fIjpegtopdf\fP. This allows making
the pdf file smaller.
