.SH DESRIPTION

Create a single PDF file out of a sequence of JPEG image. Each page of the
output file contains one image, resized to be as large as possible while still
fitting the page size both horizontally and vertically.

.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI -m " margin
the margin to leave on all sides of the images

.TP
.BI -x " x
the horizontal displament of the images in the page;
by default, they are placed centrally

.TP
.BI -y " y
the vertical displament of the images in the page;
by default, they are placed centrally

.TP
.BI -w " width
the width of the input images; this is usually unnecessary;
it is not the width of the image on the page unless \fI-s 1\fP is also given

.TP
.BI -e " height
the height of the input images; this is usually unnecessary;
it is not the height of the image on the page unless \fI-s 1\fP is also given

.TP
.BI -s " scale
scale input images by this amount;
the default is to enlarge or shrink the page just enough to fit the page

.TP
.BI -p " paper
size of the pages; default is the content of \fI/etc/papersize\fP if this file
exists, otherwise is \fIA4\fP; this argument takes three possible forms:

.RS

.IP "  * " 4
.I name
the string identifying the paper size, like \fIA4\fP or \fIletter\fP

.IP "  * "
.I WxH
the width and height of the page, in points

.IP "  * "
.I scale
each page is as large as the image scaled by this number

.RE
.PD

.TP
.BI -r " rotations
each character in the argument tells how to rotate each input image; 0 is no
rotation, 1 is 90 degrees clockwise, 2 is 180 degrees clockwise, 3 is 270
degress clockwise; 'a' and 'A' are like 1 and 3 but only when the width of the
image is smaller than its height; if the string is shorter than the number of
pages, its last character is the rotation of the remaining pages; for example,
\fI-r 1\fP rotates all pages 90 degrees clockwise

.TP
.B -t
sort pages to reconstruct a two-side document scanned with a single-side ADF;
in practice: scan the document front-side up, scan it again front-side down (do
not reorder the pages), then use this option; the last page (the n/2+1-th) can
be skipped if empty

.TP
.BI -o " file.pdf
the name of the output file; \fI-\fP stands for standard output; the default is
.I output.pdf

.TP
.B -h
inline help

.P
One of the input files may be \fI-\fP for standard input.

.
.
.
.SH NOTE

The JPEG images are directly copied to the output PDF file. This means that
resolution is not changed. However, the original JPEG images can be resized
with \fInetpbm(1)\fP before passing them to \fIjpegtopdf\fP. This allows making
the pdf file smaller.
